TODO

-Replace _ALL THE ICONS_ with Gnome Symbolic Icons [In PROGRESS]
-Browser Testing...Browser Testing....and some more Browser Testing
-Find Areas of the Board that look broken with the new Theme [looking good so far]
-Remove the Gnome Look Header [DONE]
-Remove the Gnome Look Footer(?)...we could do something akin to it, just not use the original Grass Image maybe?

-Fix the horrible, horrible User Image Treatment of Vanilla Boards, we probably will have to push a different template for the Profile that
will degrade the User Pic from living in an img-tag to a background image of the wrapping div to make sure we can:
	1. Keep the nice borders intact
	2. Make the image scale properly to the size of the box without constantly breaking the element layout of the Profile 


-Remove unneccessary Code from the custom.css
	Since we're getting closer to having all the Elements styled properly we can start removing all the css code that just duplicates code in the style.css, i bet we can save like 50K cause right now it will just pass 80% the exact same css code twice.
